## About
This is a very simple program where 2 human players play American Checkers.
These are the following rules for American Checkers:
* Checker pieces can only move diagonally and toward the opponent's side of the board.
* A player captures an opponent's piece when they jump over that piece onto an empty square. If a player jumps over a piece and is able to capture another enemy piece, then they must do so.
* If a player can capture a piece, they must capture that piece. They cannot make any move that does not involve capturing one or more pieces.
* If the player's piece reaches the topmost (or bottommost) row of the board on the opponent's side, the player's piece becomes a 'king' and is able to move diagonally in any direction.
* The game ends when one of the players loses all of their pieces.
* The program must be restarted to play more than one game.

## Origin of Game
This was made when I was first learning about Java's GUI API, javax.swing, 
back in my senior year of high school.
